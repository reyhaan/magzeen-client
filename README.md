## Overview
Project contains:
- A simple Node API
- Client (React, Ant Design UI library, React-Router, Parcel bundler)

## Highlight

### Chartman

I imagined this component as a wrapper for NVD3 library. The main idea is that a user is only concerned with 'Dimensions' and 'Measures' and same should apply for development process. 

This component allows you to specifiy `type of chart`, `dimension`, `measure`, `aggregation function` to render a chart

## Dev setup
1. clone repo and make sure you have NodeJS installed.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start node API server.
4. Run `npm restart` to start client server.

The setup is using `Parcel` as packager so it should start listening to changes right away.
